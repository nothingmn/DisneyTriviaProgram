# DisneyTriviaProgram

This is a trivia game program that tests how much a person knows about Disney movies. 
The program consists of 100 random questions about different Disney movies. 
The player has the choice to answer all 100 questions or however many they would like to answer.
After the player chooses however many questions they would like to answer the questions get asked one by one.
Once the player answers all the questions, at the end the program will show how many questions the player answered right and which questions they got wrong if they even got any wrong.
